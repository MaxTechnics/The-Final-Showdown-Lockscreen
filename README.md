# The-Final-Showdown-Lockscreen
The Source Code for the lockscreen from our end of year event at school

## This is not a secure system!
## Explaining:

At the end of the school year, we had a digital event with a lottery with it. Troughout the live stream, letters were hidden. These form a password that would be entered in this page. If correct, you can join the Jitsi meet session.

To make it harder to find the password, I used [Obfuscator.io](https://obfuscator.io/) with dead code, self defending code etc. This proved effective as the password was not taken out of the inspect element during the event.

### Contributions
This is just an archive of the source code for this event. The code is no longer under development. Feel free to mess around with it though! If you have any questions, feel free to open an issue.
